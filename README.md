# Minecraft Team Management

A simple web-based management system for Minecraft server teams.

## Setup Instructions for GitHub Pages

1. Make sure all files are in the correct location:
   - `index.html` should be at the root of your repository
   - `dashboard.html` should be at the root of your repository

2. In your GitHub repository:
   - Go to Settings > Pages
   - Select your branch (usually `main` or `master`)
   - Save to deploy your site

3. Your site will be available at `https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/`

## Login Information

For demo purposes, you can use any of these usernames:
- MaxMC (Owner)
- JaneDoeMC (Co-Owner)
- AlexMC (Admin)
- SamBuilds (Builder)
- ChrisSupport (Supporter)
- EmilyDev (Developer)

Any password will work for the demo.

## Features

- User authentication with permission levels
- Team member management
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Security Note

This is a client-side only demo that uses localStorage for authentication. In a real application, you would need server-side authentication and database storage.
